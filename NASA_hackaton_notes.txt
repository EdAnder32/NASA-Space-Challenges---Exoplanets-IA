##	DESCRIPTION
	The document below contains some of my notes about IA during my study for NASA hackaton

##	CONTEXT
	 I get enroled into a challenge where me and my team must build an IA model that hunt exoplanets

##	INTRO
	 Exoplanets are planets outside our solar system. NASA use a method to find those planets. The
	method use parametres like radial velocity, transit method and astronomy. Each of then give
	conditions that help us to predict the atual existence of a new exoplanet. That started after
	NASA launch in 2009 'KEPLER' to get data from space

##	1. AI methods
	 In AI context, unfortunatelly we dont have yet much papers that show how to train models that
	hunt exoplanets. The paper that i work with actually is 'Assessment of Ensemble-Based Machine 
	Learning Algorithms for Exoplanet Identification', writed by 3 brazilian guys (you can find
	more information about it on my ASSETS_NOTES.txt file). They use Ensemble-Algorithm.
	
	1.1 Esemble algorithm: are algorithm that use others algorithms and a final voting scheme to
	provide the best possible awnser.
	
	We have 5 Esemble algorithm here that could help us building that AI model:
	-> Adaboost;
	-> Random Forest;
	-> Random Subspace Method;
	-> Extremely randomized trees;
	-> Stacking;
