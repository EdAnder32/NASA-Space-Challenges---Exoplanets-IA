# NASA-Space-Challenges: Exoplanets-IA
A Repo to all my notes about NASA hackaton -> Hunting planets with AI

# Review
There you can find some libraries that i use and its purpose

1. LigthGBM (Ligth Gradient Boosting Machine): A gradient boosting library develop by Microsoft. Kind of a better Adaboost. It is used to supervised machinel learning and it is faster.

2. Tsfresh: A python library used to extract ligth curves (you can find more about that topic in file NASA_hackaton_notes.txt). It transform the curves into a vector with attributes of numbers

3. Optuna: A python framework that optimize params for machine learning. It find automatically the best configurations

4. Scikit-learn: Thats an old gold for machine learning! A library that use and give classical algorithms implementations and tools for processing and evaluate models

5. Pandas: A library for data manipulation

6. Numpy: A library for math in python
